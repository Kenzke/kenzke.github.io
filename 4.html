            <pr>In more detail, previous studies have shown that learners with deficits in visuospatial ability experience lower learning outcomes in multi-perspective hypermedia learning environments (MHEs) (e.g., Freed et al., under review; Kornmann et al., 2016; Pazzaglia et al., 2008).</pr>

            <pr>Accordingly, in order to specifically support low-visuospatial learners, multiple relevant artworks across multiple perspectives were highlighted.
                Further, Epochal was combined with a question-panel that was displayed in a splitscreen-view next to Epochal. It provided art-history learning guidance questions to learners combined with highlights that
                marked artworks relevant to the question currently displayed in the question-panel.

            Theoretical Background
        </div>
        <div class="textblack">
            Art-history is inherently multi-perspective, i.e., knowledge of art-history requires an understanding of the connections between the historic contexts, 
                techniques, origins, artists, genres and other dimensions of art-history. Understanding art-history goes beyond knowing simple facts.
                Conversely, learning art-history in multi-perspective digital 
                learning environments requires perspective processing abilities, i.e., 
                the ability to draw connections between aspects of the different perspectives of art-history content in the learning envionment.
                For example, in order to realize and acquire the knowledge that paintings with stark light-shadow contrast (Chiaroscuro) 
                formed a characteristic of the barock period, a learner must be able to mentally
                focus on stark light-shadow contrast paintings when switching to the epoch perspective to draw this connection.
                <br><br>
                Previous studies have hypothesized visuospatial working memory (WM) to be relevant for perspective processing activities (Kornmann et al., 2016; Pazzaglia et al., 2008) and it is defined as the cognitive architecture that allows us
                to mentally and physically interact with representations of our environment and perform operations,
                for example mental rotations, on these representations (Della Sala & Logie, 2002).
                Pazzaglia et al. (2008) also theorized that visuospatial WM is relevant for handling complex visual information
                in single perspectives and, thus, may be relevant for information selection in single persectives.
                Baddeley and Hitch's working memory model,
                splits working memory into a visuospatial sketchpad, representing visuspatial WM and a phonological loop (Figure 1) and
                neuroimaging studies see many areas of the brain to be associated with visuospatial WM, such as the occipital lobe, frontal cortex
                as well as parietal and dorsal areas (Baddeley, 2002; Della Sala & Logie 2002). 
                Constantinidis & Klingberg (2016) especially see areas in the lateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex to be implicated in visuospatial WM (Figure 2).
                Moreover, ongoing research in psychology and cognitive neuropsychology postulate visuospatial WM to be a unified system in the brain (Baddeley, 2002).

                <br>    


                In line with previous studies, this study considered visuospatial ability to be relevant for perspective processing activities across multiple perspectives and information selection in single perspectives.
                Thereby providing an explanation for the predictivity of visuospatial ability on learning gains.
                Further, it was theorized that visuospatial ability, which was considered to be an application of visuospatial WM to a real-visuospatial task, 
                enabled perspective processing activities through higher visuospatial WM capacity.
                In more detail, it was theorized that visuspatial WM capacity may enable mental comparisons and perspectives switching by facilitating 
                the cognitive architecture to hold on to visuospatial information chunks during a perspective switch and, thus, allowing mental comparisons between perspectives (Baddeley, 2002).
            <br><br>
                Next to visuospatial ability, this study also considered self-regulated learning (SRL) to be an ability guiding learning success in open-ended digital learning environments, such as Epochal (Gerjets & Hesse, 2004).
                SRL, by definition, encompasses multiple different types of activities, cognitive, metacognitive, motivational and affective, while pursuing learning goals (Pintrich, 2000; Zimmermann, 2000).
                For example, in Epochal a learner was free to choose if he or she rather liked to learn about how
                the colour palettes in paintings varied in Barock compared to Renaissance paintings or if he or she
                rather liked to spend time on reading about Dürer. Learning in environments that offer the learner large amounts of freedom
                require the learner to be able set learning goals, reflect on learning progress and success, i.e. the ability to perform SRL, to learn succesfully. 
                The relevance of
                SRL for learning in digital learning environments is, thus, underlined.
                <br><br>
                Finally this experiment also drew connections to research on attention. More specifically, highlighting was assumed to act as an exogenous cue, 
                and based on the Posner cueing paradigm (Posner & Cohen, 1984) it was expected for highlighting to guide attention, and consequently, behaviour of learners.
                <br><br>
            <pr>Conclusively, this project combined multiple research areas, not only limited to learning behaviour and success. It, thus, turned out to be incredibly complex.</pr><br>
            The experiment was conducted entirely on 13inch Microsoft Surface tablets, in a university room with minimal distraction. 
            <pr>Sixty (N = 60) participants were invited to obtain results and to minimize statistical noise in the data. The experiment consisted of an art-history pre- and post-test, a visuospatial ability test, art-history interest questions, demographic surveys and a 30-min learning phase in the learning environment. The total duration of the experiment was about 1hr. Further, participants received a 10Euro compensation.</pr>
            <pr>Throughout the whole experiment more than 15 experimental variables were measured. They were collected via the log-data of the app during the learning phase, the visuospatial test and the survey data.</pr>
            <pr>The types of learning behaviour derived from the app log-data, consisted of durations spent in certain parts of the app and click-rates of specific elements/artworks in the app.</pr>
            <br><br>

                Data analysis was performed in R and following guidelines from Field et al. (2012). Effects were measured via multiple type III ANCOVA models, as the focus was put on measuring interaction-effects. 
                ANCOVA models were chosen in order to control for effects of known predictor variables, such as visuospatial ability.
                <br><br>The main ANCOVA model was defined as:
            </div>
            <div class="textblack" style="text-align: center;">
                learning gains ~ number of opened QP questions + visuospatial ability x highlight
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="textblack">
            <pr>All these research areas outlined above were boiled down to five research questions that lead to five hypotheses set up prior to experiment. 
                They concerned the effect of highlighting on learning gains (post-test score vs. pre-test score), learning behaviour, learning performance (in the Question-Panel) and attention.</pr>

            <br><br>
            <pr>H1: Learners that receive highlighting will have higher learning gains compared to learners in the control group.</pr>
            <br><br>
            <pr>H2: Visuospatial ability predicts learning gains across both highlighting and control groups.</pr>
            <br><br>
            <pr>H3: Highlighting increases learning gains to a significantly larger degree with learners with lower visuospatial ability than with learners with higher visuospatial ability.</pr>
            <br><br>
            <pr>H4: Highlighting increases the number of correct QP questions during learning.</pr>
            <br><br>
            <pr>H5: Highlighting will guide behaviour in Epochal by significantly increasing click-rates of highlighted artworks.</pr>

            <br>
            Results showed highlighting to have supported low-visuospatial learners in achieving greater learning gains than the control group.
            However, high-visuospatial learners achieved lower learning gains in the highlighting group than in the control group.
            Thus, there was an interaction effect between highlighting and visuospatial ability and H2 was confirmed.
            Highlighting appeared to have a levelling effect on learning gains, partially counteracting the predictive effect of visuospatial ability on learning gains (Figure 1).
            An implication that can be drawn from this experiment can therefore be that MHEs with a Question-Panel should be designed with highlighting for low-visuospatial learners. On the other hand, the MHE should be presented without highlighting to high-visuospatial learners

            <br>
            The number of opened highlighted images acted as a measure of highlighting guided behaviour, in the experiment.
            In order to balance for the total number of opened images per learner, a ratio between the number of highlighted-image opens and total image opens was determined.
            The t-test comparison of this ratio between the groups revealed a highly significant group difference (p &lt; 0.0001) (H5 comfirmed).
            Figure 2 visualizes the comparison of highlighted-opens between groups. It is noted that in the control group, images that would have been highlighted in the highlighting group were counted as a number of potentially highlighted image-opens. 
            This way it was extrapolated how much highlighting guided image-opens when comparing the groups. 
            Further, it was presumed that highlighting guided attention, as attention-redirection was viewed as a necessary precedant to the clicking and opening of images.
            <br><br>
            My thesis was written on the results of this experiment in which I also elaborate on the underlying cognitive mechanisms and what role visuospatial ability plays.

        <div class="textblack">
                <pr>Digital learning environments offer considerable opportunities for learning complex topics. Yet
                research has found that learners with deficits regarding individual learners’ characteristics necessary
                to engage in self-regulated learning (SRL) and visuospatial ability have difficulties learning in these
                environments. Considering this ambiguity, fifty-four (N = 54) participants were invited to learn
                about art-history on a tablet-based multi-perspective hypermedia learning environment (MHE) in
                an experiment, while learning gains and behavior were related to individual visuospatial ability. A
                Question-Panel (QP) provided learning guidance via questions concerning the learning material
                during learning. Further in the experimental group, relevant artworks concerning the QP-questions
                were visually highlighted across multiple perspectives, aiming to lower cognitive load. Results
                revealed highlighting to have supported low-visuospatial learners in attaining higher learning gains
                but limited high-visuospatial learners who scored lower learning gains than the control group. It is
                theorized that highlighting assisted low-visuospatial learners in information selection and
                perspective processing, by reducing visuospatial working-memory requirements but limited highvisuospatial
                learners to potentially attend to more artworks than suggested. Further, it is supposed
                that highlighting acted as an exogenous cue which guided attention and, thus, significantly
                increased click-rates of highlighted artworks. This study confirmed visuospatial ability as a
                predictor of learning gains in MHEs, instructional theories of digital learning environments and set
                forth concrete visual design implications for MHEs.</pr>
