                The presented projects intend to illustrate from which different directions and how I approached <em>design perception</em>.
                I researched 'machine perception' from a machine learning/informatics perspective, opening up connections to philosophy and neuroscience by asking the question of the nature of consciousness and visual perception.
                Next, in my Bachelor's Thesis, I investigated the effect of concrete visual and instructional design features of a digital art-learning environment on learning success and attention from a psychological and cognitive-neuropsychological perspective by means of an empirical experiment.
                In my last project, I explored how perception may be also be formed by a haptic interaction with the environment, drawing connections to cognitive embodiment theory in a design project.
                These projects provided answers but also open up many more questions that could extend into, and thereby connect, different areas; Research questions such as:
                <br><br>
                RQ1: how do spaces, shapes, surfaces, colours, graphics, textures affect perception in different modalities, digital, physical, auditory, etc.?
                <br><br>
                This research question would guide the analysis of design features of real-world and digital environments of different modalities on psychological, neurobiological and cognitive neuropsychological metrics and constructs. 
                Future experimental projects using methods of empirical sciences such as psychology, statistics, neurobiology and cognitive science could investigate how graphics, shapes, textures and colours affect perception. 
                Particularly by drawing connections to material design, architecture, design and art. In future projects I would especially like to apply eye-tracking technologies to investigate how the design of physical spaces affects perception.
                It could connect to a current cooperation project I'm working with, between the universities of Tübingen and Vienna, and the Galerie Belvedere (e.g., 
                <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7962802/" class="nav-link-text">Reitstätter et al., 2020</a>
                ). This particular project, investigates how art-perception is guided by the museums' design by equipping visitors of the Galerie Belvedere with mobile eye trackers.
                Future projects in the <em>Design & Computation</em> Master could investigate how the presentation form of art and the use of materials and colours in exhibition spaces and museums affect art-perception, as both the UdK and TU berlin provide the right context and technologies for exhibiton research.
                Morever, future projects could investigate how the perception of design features in digital AR and VR spaces affects perception.
                This project could draw connections to my bachelor thesis on digital art-learning and could also begin investigating digital art-exhibition concepts.
                Further, in this project connections to the topic of digital archives can also be drawn. 
                <br><br>
                RQ2: what characterizes 'machine perception'? Where do the differences and parallels between perception of computers and humans lie? And what further contact points does it have to neural structures?
                <br><br>
                In continuation of my projects on adversarial attacks, I would like to question the nature of perception of machines. 
                It is a project of philosophical nature, investigating if machines can perceive, how machine processing can be visualized and made tangible. 
                Further, it opens questions concerning how machine and digital visual processing differs from human visual information processing, 
                what kind of parallels can be drawn to human perception and how machinal processing in turn affect societal structures. 
                I would like to step into contact with computer scientists and machine learning experts to work on projects and gain more practical and theoretical knowledge in 
                machine learning, neural networks and other computational systemss. 
                Also, I would like also draw connections to the neurosciences that analyze biological systems and neural information processing structures of the brain. 
                Lastly, a study would allow me to draw parallels to research investigating the effect of machine learning on society from the perspective of the social sciences.
                <br><br>
                RQ3: How do digital environments affect language and how does language in digital environments affect perception?
                <br><br>
                Language is influenced by the medium it is conveyed with, for example in digital environments, such as social media or in digital archives.
                Further, digital media can act as a multi- and cross-cultural spaces in which language is used in a much more dynamic environment and it is exposed to a greater number of driving forces.
                This may manifest in language use, semantics and pragmatics.
                It is presumed that language may guide cognition, for example, mental representations can find basis in language representations, as reaction-time experiments and neurocognitive studies show (e.g., Dietrich et al., 2006; Hertrich et al., 2020).
                Following, technological designs may also affect cognition by altering the nature of the medium in which language is used.
                This may affect the individual and society profoundly and research into this area may provide potential in uncovering interactions between language, perception in cognition.
                How do these changes in the medium affect language and how does the change in language affect perception in altered environments?
                <br><br>
                Further topics I'm interested in investigating are: digital learning environments, digital archives and knowledge structures, emotion in digital environments, cognitive embodiment theory 
                applied to engineering of interactive interfaces, and many more...
                <br><br>
                Finally I'd just like to recommend the paper 
                <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364661316000668" class="nav-link-text">What is the bandwidth of perceptual experience?</a>
                 by Cohen, Dennett and Kanwisher (2016). It is a fantastic read demonstrating how cognitive science can approach hard
                questions that extend into philosophy, such as visual consciousness, by combining different methodologies and perspectives.
                <br><br><br>
                A place in the trans- and interdisciplinary Masters Program Design and Computation would provide me with a context and frame of reference under which I could extend existing research projects, deepen competences and draw inspiration in contact with other experts of other fields.
                More importantly, it would allow me to work on future projects investigating <em>design perception</em> with a widened scope of analysis, cutting-edge technological tools and fellow researchers to launch ambitious projects with. 
                A simple cognitive science master could not provide me with the right context as I am interested in finding and looking for further connections to other domains that go beyond cognitive science and carry a larger importance for society and technological designs. 
                I am motivated to take a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to investigate how technology, cognition and design are intertwined in the context of the inter- and transdisciplinary Design & Computation Master shared between the TU and UdK Berlin.
