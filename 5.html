                Active Creation forms Design Perception?

                The process of design perception can also include active processes of creation. 
                This project was a haptic dialog between mind, body and environment that form part of cognition and design perception based on the embodied cognitive theory.
                It was produced in the context of a seminar with

                This work was inspired by the Yoyogi National Stadium, an indoor arena in Tokyo, Yoyogi which was designed by Kenzo Tange in 1964.
                A steel cable construction that spans parabolic minimal surfaces acts as a roof and covers the building. It forms the central aspect of the architecture.
                The building combines dynamic shapes and surfaces with heavy, massive and sturdy materials such as concrete and steel, by using the most advanced technologies of the time.
                I first saw the building in person in 2017, however, the process of actively exploring and expressing my interest in a creation-perception interaction with the material plaster continued my process of design perception. 
                The dramatic curves and fluid transitions formed by the solid and heavy materials, concrete and steel, formed the contradiction that guided my exploration.

            <div class="textblack">
                
                In a process of actively questioning and exploring my perception of the building and the architectural concept, three shapes and surfaces made from plaster and iron resulted from the haptic dialog with the material.
                The process of creating these shapes and surfaces formed the exploration of my perception of the building; it represents a process of introspection. At the same time, it is an attempt to visualize, communicate and elaborate on what exactly captured my attention in the architecture. It also represents a form of outward visual communcation.
                Thus, the process of creation and perception are closely intertwined and the material formed
                an active part of perception of design. This work attempts to communicate, how design is not only passively perceived but creating design can also form a central part of the process of actively perceiving. 
                Based on embodied cognition theory, cognition finds representation in not only the mind, but may extend to sensorimotor representations in body and environment in a dynamic process (Butz & Kutter, 2013; Foglia & Wilson, 2013). 
                Please also see the study of Caramazza et al. (2014) for a critical take on embodied cogntion.
                <br><br>
                What results of this analysis are multiple shapes and surfaces, artworks, images, designs, that represent design perception as a meta-concept but also formed part of a cognitive process itself.
                The product is a manifestation of design perception, an artefact of an active dialog between individual and environment, a design that continues to represent an active process of design perception, which was externalised and formed part of a cognitive process of design perception.
                <br><br>
                Conclusively, perception of a design may not be a passive process entirely. Rather, design perception could be the result of a dynamic interactive process in which cognition is based in mind, body and environment, following cognitive embodiment theory.
                Further, perception could result from active interaction with interfaces in the environment.
                But in what magnitude is our environment implicated in our private cognitive processes and in how far exactly is design entangled in conscious perception? 
                And how can these ideas be applied to the design of technological interfaces?
                These are further questions I would like to investigate in future projects.

            I would like to thank Jürgen Wittke for capturing the photos of the exhibition, and allowing me to use them for this online portfolio. 
            Further, I would like to thank Zurab Bero for leading the course and giving me the opportunity to explore my interest in an exploratory context.
            Lastly, I would like to thank Ernst Seidl, the director of the Museum of the University of Tübingen (MUT), for organizing the exhibition and organizing the 'invited artist' workshop.
