            The projects I present in this portfolio share the guiding theme, <em>Design Perception</em>, and transcend borders of individual domains and sciences.
            It is a theme that lies at the intersection of many different areas of research and, thus, requires combining multiple different scientific perspectives to gain a holistic understanding.
            For example, the topic of human perception entails considering fundamental questions of human consciousness 
            that can be approached from, for example, neurobiological, psychological and philosophical perspectives.
            Yet further, researching <em>design perception</em> also requires realizing the importance of perspectives from architecture, material science, engineering and art, 
            fields that work under the term 'design'. 
            <br>Considering contemporary challenges of the 21st century that have gained shape under technological developments, 
            for example, digital privacy and freedom, climate change and challanges in education,  
            it is necessary to consider how perception and design interact with each other.
            Moreover, it is necessary to study these interactions beyond borders of single sciences and traditions, as they may take form in emergent and hybrid fields of study (Winograd & Flores, 1998).
            The projects I present in this portfolio intend to illustrate how I approach the topic <em>Design Perception</em>.
            and how I attempt to combine the different fields of cognitive science, for example, neurobiology, informatics, psychology, with design. 
            This first text intends to provide a rough definition of <em>design perception</em> and articulates the importance of cognitive science for research on <em>design perception</em>.
            It outlines the nature of the cognitive science approach and how design and cognition may be connected.
            I see research on design perception to be critical for society in times of the digitization and the introduction of radically new technological designs. 
            This radical change of the nature and medium of the environment that surrounds us, will shape how we perceive and, thus, interact with and consciously experience our surroundings and it will deeply affect the individual, society and what it means to be human.

            Introduction
        </div>
        <div class="textblack">
            The visual percept, i.e., the visual conscious experience that results from perceiving an object, depends on intricate cognitive processes in the mind of the human observer. In more detail, visual perception can be described as the process of light reflecting from a design/observed object and the resulting neural processing of reflected light which is collected in the eye. 
            Further neural processing can be discriminated into the areas of, for example, object recognition, colour perception, attention allocation and other domains of perception (Wagemans et al., 2005; Wolfe et al., 2017). Different areas in cognitive science research this topic (and many more topics related to cognition) from different scientific perspectives. The visual percept can thereby be seen as a result or by-product of the cognitive processes involved in visual information processing and the search for neural correlates of visual consciousness build upon this premise (e.g., Blake et al., 2014; Koch et al., 2016). Cognitive science offers a unique advantage in investigating these processes as it considers human cognition from a holistic and interdisciplinary perspective, integrating all sciences involved in investigating cognition: Psychology, Neurobiology, Linguistics, Philosophy, Mathematics, Anthropology and Informatics.
            <br><br>
            Nevertheless, some recent advances in cognitive science see problems in the view that visual perception and visual consciousness 
            result purely from internal representations and neural activities (O’Regan & Noë, 2002). In more detail, visual conscious perception 
            is generally not anymore considered entirely a ‘bottom-up’ process. Neisser and Kosslyn, for example, see visual perception and visual attention allocation 
            as dependant on both ‘bottom-up’ and ‘top-down’ processes of visual perception which form a <em>perceptual circle</em> (Neisser, 1978; Kosslyn, 2001). 
            Further, current trends in cognitive science in the form of embodied cognition theory see cognition to be closely interconnected to the mind, the body and the environment in a dynamic process (Butz & Kutter, 2016). 
            In more detail, following embodied cognition theory, conscious visual experiences in the mind result from continuous sensorimotor interactions of body and environment; 
            perception and interaction are closely intertwined, and cognition is based in both body and mind (inner border of cognition in Figure 1) (O’Regan & Noë, 2002).
             In line with these theories, design perception can be seen as a process that extends passive observation of designs and also results from active interaction with the environment. This idea is communicated in the project 
            <a href="5.html" class="nav-link-text">Shapes & Surfaces.</a>
            Here, design perception is seen in the context of cognitive embodiment theory in which visual conscious perception results from a continuous feedback loop between the body, the mind and design in a process of continuous interaction and perception (Figure 1).

            ‘The extended mind’, a philosophical thought experiment from Clark and Chalmers (1998) even makes a strong case for extending the mind beyond the borders of the brain and the body. Accordingly, cognition can be based both in and outside the body. 
            Clark and Chalmers question borders between the mind and outside environments that are set by traditional views. 
            Further, they argue that elements in the environment oftentimes form parts of cognition in a process termed <em>active externalism</em>. 
            They provide an interesting thought experiment, drawing parallels to embodied cognition theory, putting into question traditional views of cognition and posing the question where the borders of cognition lie (outer border of cognition in Figure 1?).
            <br><br>
            In sum, design perception is not only seen as a result of passive neural processing of the environment. 
            The process of visual conscious experience may not simply result of passive perception or bottom-up processes. 
            Rather, design perception could be seen as the result of a continuous process of perception and interaction, which bases mental representations in body, mind, environment and design. 
            Design perception may also include creation of design, as cognition may also extend to including design. 
            However, it is important to note that this project is a work in progress and the connection between design and perception is in no way uncovered.
            This text and these projects only act as a part of multiple iterations of a continuous exploration of the topic and provides first concrete ideas.
            It is critical to bridge the gap between design and cognition, and investigate how perception and design are entangled, both in the physical and in digital realms. 
            Especially, considering the digitization which produces artificial digital environments
            at an accelarated rate and may also represent a distancing from natural environments.
            The question how artifical technological designs affect perception has to be posed and investigated, in order to 
            create desirable technological environments for the future and avoid dystopian societal developments.            
            <br><br>
            The following projects in my portfolio illustrate different approaches I took in order to investigate <em>design perception</em>:
            a machine learning/informatics approach paired with philosophical questions (<a href="3.html" class="nav-link-text">3/6</a>), an approach from learning psychology and cognitive neuropsychology based on an empirical experiment (<a href="4.html" class="nav-link-text">4/6</a>) and an experimental creative approach (<a href="5.html" class="nav-link-text">5/6</a>). Lastly, I elaborate on which further connections and intersections I would like to research in the future under the topic of design perception (<a href="6.html" class="nav-link-text">6/6</a>).
